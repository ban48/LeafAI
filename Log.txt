"PlantVillage" dataset -> good, but some relevant informations about species/diseases are missing. In few words, for some species only "healthy" or "ill" images existed.
Already divided in training and validation (used as testing) sets.

We decided to delete the species with only "ill" images (orange and squash in outr case). The idea was: is better to unsuccessfully classify a disease rather than wrongly classifying.
BEFORE: 14 species - 21 diseases (including "healthy")
DOPO: 12 species - 20 diseases 

Later, for normalization, we needed to compute the mean and the standard deviation of our dataset. After we had computed it, we stored the results here:
true_mean = [ 0.47131167, 0.49435022, 0.42405355 ]
true_std = [ 0.17719288, 0.14827244, 0.19360321 ]
